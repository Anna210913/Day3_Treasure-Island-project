# Treasure Island (My Version)
A text-based adventure gameâ€¦ with a twist.  
Your mission is to find the treasure, but the journey is full of weird, funny, and slightly tragic endings.

## What I learned
- Using nested `if` statements for decision-making  
- Taking user input and making the game interactive  
- Adding my own creative spin to a template project  

## How to run
1. Click the green **Code** button â†’ **Download ZIP** â†’ unzip the folder.  
2. Run `treasure_island.py` with Python.  

**Tip:** Choose wiselyâ€¦ or enjoy the ridiculous consequences. ðŸ˜‰
